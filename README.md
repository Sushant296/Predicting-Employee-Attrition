Employee Attrition Prediction using Machine Learning
This project aims to predict whether an employee will leave the organization (attrition) based on various features like job role, age, satisfaction level, and more. We utilize a Random Forest Classifier model on a real-world HR dataset to build a reliable prediction system.

üìå Key Features
Uses a clean dataset with encoded categorical values

Visualizes correlations through a heatmap

Implements a Random Forest model for classification

Evaluates performance using Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, and Classification Report

üß∞ Technologies Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Seaborn, Matplotlib

Scikit-learn (LabelEncoder, train_test_split, RandomForestClassifier, metrics)

üìù Steps Performed
Loaded and explored the dataset

Encoded categorical features using LabelEncoder

Checked for missing values

Visualized feature correlations using a heatmap

Split data into training and testing sets

Trained a Random Forest model

Evaluated the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

‚úÖ Results
The model provides high accuracy in predicting employee attrition and can help organizations identify employees at risk of leaving.
